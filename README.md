# Face-_Mask_V1

This is my own small project used via transfer learning with the vgg16 model I have trained the model with only 5 epochs it will be much more progressive if I would use a 50 -100 epoch but will do that later

The point remaining with the project is that I have to make the OPEN Cv modeule for the model and deploy it to the Streamlit cloud

I will complete it as soon as I will get time for this project

It had 4097 trainable parameters and performs well with an accuracy of 91% within just 5 epoch
